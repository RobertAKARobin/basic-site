TCP/IP and UDP are different Internet protocols – different ways computers talk to each other. The main difference between them is that TCP/IP includes a lot of checks and balances to make sure the data being transmitted is error-free, whereas UDP does not.

That makes them better for different applications: TCP/IP has higher integrity but slower speed, and UDP has lower integrity but higher speed.

When you’re viewing a livestream, you’re probably using UDP: it’s much more important that every pixel shows up on time than that every pixel is glitch-free. When you’re viewing a webpage, you’re probably using TCP/IP: the data that shows up on your screen mostly just stays there in one place, so it makes sense to put out some extra effort to ensure the data is glitch-free.

**The joke is** that TCP/IP requires computers to basically ask each other a lot of questions to make sure data is sent correctly, and the users in the conversation are asking each other a lot of questions to make sure the “joke” is sent correctly.

The tweet being a UDP joke, and the author not caring “if you get it,” is a play on words. In UDP, data is sent without making sure the recipient received it correctly. The author doesn’t care if you “get it” in the sense of understanding the joke, and in the sense of whether you physically received the joke at all.
