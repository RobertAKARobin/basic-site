Git and GitHub are often confused. **Git** is basically a piece of software. It lets you create “snapshots” of your code at different points in time and store these snapshots in collections called repositories, or _repos_. This way, if you decide you don’t like the direction you’re going with your code, you can look at an earlier snapshot and pick up from there. **GitHub** is a company that provides a place online to store these repos. There are now many services like GitHub, including GitLab, BitBucket, and others, but GitHub is the most popular.

In mid-2018 it was announced that Microsoft appears to be buying GitHub. Microsoft is frequently perceived as a sort-of “Big Brother” character in technology, with a tendency to take absorb products and then make them worse (e.g. Skype). Whether or not this perception is warranted is very much a matter of opinion.

The joke here is that many GitHub users are expecting Microsoft to make GitHub worse, and so are eyeing alternatives like GitLab, to Microsoft’s dismay.
