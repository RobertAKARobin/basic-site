PHP is one of the world’s most popular programming languages for websites and web applications.

It’s also one of the oldest. It started as a way for [one guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf) to make it easier to update his website (‘PHP’ originally stood for 'Personal Home Page’). There weren’t many other tools like it at the time, so others started using it, and adding on their own new features and functionality.

PHP continued to grow organically, without much oversight. As a result, it’s a bit of a mish-mash of different ideas and styles and isn’t very consistent, in the same way that English spelling isn’t very consistent.

> Yes, English can be weird. It can be understood through tough thorough thought though.

This is different from most programming languages, which are created very intentionally, and have very clear and consistent rules about how they should be written. As a result, programmers like to make fun of PHP as an example of a “bad programming language” (although in recent years a lot of effort has been put into making PHP “better”).

**The joke is** that the author is embarrassed to work for a porn company, which you might expect because porn has historically been taboo – but it turns out that their source of embarrassment is actually the fact that they’re writing PHP for the porn company, not the nature of the company itself.
