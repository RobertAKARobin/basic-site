_Compiling_ is the process of converting your code (easy-ish for you to read and understand, but difficult for a computer to understand) into "bytecode" or "machine code" (virtually impossible for a human to read and understand, but much easier for a computer to understand).

One of the problems encountered most frequently by programmers is their code not compiling. If there is a bug or error in their code, compilation will fail and the programmer will see an error. When a programmer encounters a problem without an obvious solution, it can be tempting to start "throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping some of it sticks." That is: changing random things in your code to see if it fixes the problem.

The joke here is that it can be extremely disconcerting when trying something random actually _does_ fix the problem, and causes the code to compile successfully. The programmer suddenly finds themselves trying to remember what they changed, or in the case they changed many things all at the same time, trying to figure which of those many things made the difference. They are now trying to understand a completely different problem, which is that they donâ€™t know how their original problem was solved.
