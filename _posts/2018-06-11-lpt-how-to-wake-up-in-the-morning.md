_(‘LPT’ stands for 'life pro tip’, a suggested habit or action that can improve your life.)_

You can think of a database as being similar to a Microsoft Excel file: it’s made up of 'tables’, which are made up of rows and columns.

When creating an application with a database, it’s a good practice to actually create at least two databases: one for _production_ (the “real” or “live” one), and one or more for testing. Test databases usually contain fake data. This way, you can test code without accidentally deleting or overwriting anything important.

For example, if you’re a programmer for a bank, you wouldn’t want to use the production database to test out a piece of code that renames a bank account: you might accidentally rename the bank accounts of _all your customers_.

**The joke is** deleting a table in a production database is terrifying because the action typically can’t be reversed – when the data is gone, it’s gone forever – so doing it will give you a rush of adrenaline.
