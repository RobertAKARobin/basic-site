[Sophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)) is a robot that has been given a human-like prosthetic face and a high degree of artificial intelligence. There are many videos of Sophia having "conversations" with humans.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a quality of a computer program that means it can respond to different data in different ways. The higher the caliber of a program’s AI, the more able it will be to respond to unpredictable events. For example, if Sophia’s AI was sufficiently advanced, speaking to her would feel as natural as speaking to a human.

**The joke is** that artificial intelligence is a very "hot" industry that is perceived as being extremely cutting-edge, but under the hood all intelligence – both artificial and natural – is basically just a big set of rules that says, "If X happens, do Y." Writing `if`/`then` logic is one of the most basic parts of programming, and one of the first thing coding students learn. This makes AI seem a lot less impressive.
