A _tree_ is a way of visualizing a sequence of events, decisions, or data that "belongs" to other data (like a family tree). The one shown here demonstrates that a series of 3 yes-or-no questions can be answered in 8 different ways. This kind of diagram is useful when figuring out how to make a computer program respond to different kinds of user data, for example.

**The joke is** that the scientists who created this way of visualizing data didn’t name it properly: they were so stereotypically nerdy they didn’t go outside enough to know that a tree spreads out as a it goes _up_, not _down_.
