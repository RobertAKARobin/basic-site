Java is a programming language that was originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).

**The joke is** a reference to Java’s original developer. It may also be a reference to a marketing slogan used by Oracle, “3 billion devices run Java,” which is such a great number it may be exaggerated and include things that aren’t even computers. It may also refer to a perceived tendency for Java programs to require a lot of processing power, causing computers to heat up.
