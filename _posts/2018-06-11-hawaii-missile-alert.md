In early 2018 an emergency message was broadcast across the state of Hawaii, alerting the population to an incoming ballistic missile. This sent the state into a panic, until a little while later a follow-up message clarified that there was _no_ incoming missile, and that it was simply a test alert.

It turned out this was all due to a state employee meaning to click on a ‘Send Test Alert’ button, and accidentally clicking on a 'Send Real Alert’ button. In other words, the whole state went into chaos because of a bad user interface. This triggered a lot of programming jokes, including guesses about what the emergency alert interface must look like, and making fun of the poor computer programmers who created it.

**Java** is a programming language. Virtually every personal computer runs software written in Java, and so every once in a while the computer’s user will be prompted to update their system to better run Java.

The company that owns Java, Oracle, sold advertising space in the Java installer/updater, and started including ads like the one pictured here for a “taskbar” created by Ask.com. Taskbars are plug-ins that you can add to your web browser that give you quick access to a few features or websites (in this case, Ask.com’s search engine, Facebook, a music player, and a weather display).

This has caused a lot of eye-rolling among programmers for a few reasons. First, although Ask.com was once a popular search engine (also known as AskJeeves) it is now largely obsolete. Second, taskbars are notorious for adding adware and malware to computers that slow them down, and should always be avoided. Third, selling ad space in an installer like this is seen as really sleazy, like selling ad space in a hospital bill.

The stereotype is that most people who are prompted to install/update Java just blindly click through the different prompts without reading them, and thus end up installing or agreeing to a bunch of stuff nobody wants, like the Ask.com taskbar.

**The joke is** not only did Oracle somehow get the ability to send missile alerts in Hawaii and add it to the Java installer, but a state employee agreed to send the alert when they weren’t paying attention.
