When programming, in order to keep your code readable, it is recommended to indent it. For example, look at this snippet:

    <page>
      <header>
        <title>Chapter 1</title>
        <subtitle>A Knock at the Door</subtitle>
      </header>
    </page>

…and compare it with this snippet:

    <page>
    <header>
    <title>Chapter 1</title>
    <subtitle>A Knock at the Door</subtitle>
    </header>
    </page>

The indentation of the first snippet provides visual cues that the “title” is inside the “header,” and that the “header” is inside the “page.” Indentation doesn’t affect the performance of your code at all, but many developers would say that whether or not your code is readable is almost as important as whether or not it works.

In the above example, I indented using two spaces per level of indentation. Alternatively, I could have used four spaces, or tabs, or something else. Different programmers have different preferences about which method of indentation is best.

This debate is often summed up as “tabs vs spaces.” It’s a source of many programming jokes since the arguments often get fairly heated, even though the kind of indentation doesn’t affect code’s performance at all.

If tabs and spaces are used for the upvote and downvote icons, the one used for upvotes would be implied to be superior to the one used for downvotes.

**The joke is** two-fold: tabs and spaces are invisible, so not only are they completely impractical for upvote/downvote icons, but also the author has managed to stir up controversy while keeping his/her opinion completely hidden since you can’t see which indentation was assigned to which icon.
