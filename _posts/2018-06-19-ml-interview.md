_Machine learning_ is the process by which computers change their behavior in response to patterns in how they’re used. For example, if you ask Siri on an iPhone a question, and the response doesn’t seem correct, you’ll probably ask Siri the question multiple times in different ways. By tracking what changed between repetitions, Siri can “learn” the characteristics of the way you ask questions (your tone of voice, speed of talking, etc), and in the future should be able to respond the correct way sooner.

In the author’s scenario, the interviewee, an expert in machine learning, is changing the way s/he answers math questions based on the interviewer’s feedback, similar to a computer implementing machine learning. The interviewee hasn’t “learned” how to answer math questions when the first question is asked, and so answers `0`. The interviewer provides feedback, saying the correct answer is `16`, so the interviewee now uses `16` as their answer to all math questions.

**The joke is** that this is a gross oversimplification of machine learning. Computers don’t start with a completely “blank slate” and would likely answer math questions correctly. In fact, computers probably wouldn’t use machine learning to answer math questions at all, since the answer to a given arithmetic problem will never change (i.e. 6 + 10 will always be 16).
