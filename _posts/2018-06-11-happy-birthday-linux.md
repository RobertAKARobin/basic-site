Linux is one of the “big three” operating systems, alongside Mac OS and Windows. It’s open-source, unlike the other two, meaning that anyone who knows how can see how it works, add new features to it, and customize it to their liking. This is a mixed bag: it’s so customizable that it can be overwhelming to learn how to even set it up, let alone actually use it.

As a result, Linux is the least popular of those three operating systems for personal computers, but the most popular for webservers, microcomputers (like Raspberry Pi and Arduino), and other more behind-the-scenes uses.

**The joke is** that setting up (or ‘compiling’) Linux is so much work, it’s like telling someone you’re going to give them a cake and then just giving them ingredients to make a cake.
