Modern detective shows tend to have a really unrealistic view of technology. In particular, they make computer applications look flashy and heavy on graphics, when in real life most of the applications wouldn’t have any graphics at all – they would just be text. Coding a visual interface (even an ugly one) takes a lot of time and effort, and so usually isn’t worth it.

A common TV trope is, when a character uses a facial-recognition application to search for a face, to quickly display all the faces that _aren’t_ a match.

Coding an application that does this (a) would require a lot of time and effort, (b) would consume a lot of computing power, since images use a lot of data, and © would be completely pointless since someone using facial-recognition just wants to see the face that matches, and doesn’t care about the faces that don’t match, and (d) the faces are shown too quickly for the user to make any sense of them anyway.

**The joke is** any sensible programmer would know this and would refuse to build the application (unless they were getting paid by the hour).
