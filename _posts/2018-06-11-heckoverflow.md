Stack Overflow is a website on which programmers can ask and answer questions related to code. (It has been expanded to many other subjects as well, such as home improvement and personal finance.) Questions and answers can be voted “up” and “down,” depending on their perceived quality. They can also be commented on.

Here, the question is “How do I do this certain thing?” and the answer is “You don’t; you do this completely different thing.” The implication of (a) the answer, (b) the fact that the answer has been massively up-voted while the question has been down-voted, and © the brief comments between the asker and answerer is that the asker is naive or stupid for even writing such a question.

**The joke is** Stack Overflow users are stereotyped as being unhelpful, because they are condescending and/or don’t actually answer the question.
